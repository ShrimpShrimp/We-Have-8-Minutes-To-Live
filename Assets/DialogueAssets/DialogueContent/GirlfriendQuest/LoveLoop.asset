  - (A moment passes. Another weighty second careening away from you like cargo containers
    tipping off a sinking ship.)
  - (You try to tell her you love her again.)
  - "\u201CI love you, I love you so much.\u201D"
  - "\u201CI know honey, I love you too.\u201D"
  - "(And then another second. You meant it this time, you\u2019re sure you did.)"
  - "(And you know she means it too. So why isn\u2019t it helping?)"
  - (Why do you feel this clenching, this heavy anxiety around this person?)
  - (She looks at you, worry in her eyes. She feels the same, you know it.)
  - "(It doesn\u2019t matter what either of you say. She isn\u2019t here, you aren\u2019t
    there.)"
  - (No words can bridge the gap distance creates.)
  - "\u201CI love you. (?)\u201D"
  - "\u201CI love you. (.)\u201D"
  - "\u201CI love you. (.)\u201D"
  - (And on and on it goes.)
