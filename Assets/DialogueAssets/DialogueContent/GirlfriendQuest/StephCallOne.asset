    you to kiss me so badly but I was terrified that you would find me creepy if
    I went for it.\u201D"
  - "\u201CI was so stupid for not going for it with you earlier, we could have had
    so much more time together. Now our last few minutes are spent miles apart, with
    literally zero chance of you seeing me.\u201D"

  - "\u201CIf you need to go you need to go, I\u2019m sorry for keeping you for so
    long.\u201D"
  - "(Her voice wavers as she says it. She desperately doesn\u2019t want you to leave,
    but the guilt of stealing you from everyone else is eating away at her.)"
